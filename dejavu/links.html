      Karen Pryor's Clicker Training
    </h3>
    <p>
      Karen Pryor is one of the pioneers in bringing operant
      conditioning (OC) and clickers into dog training. At her <a href=
      "http://www.karenpryor.com/training/clicker_basics/">Clicker
      Basics</a> page you'll find introductory information about what
      OC and clicker training means. With those ideas on your mind, you
      can then move on to some <a href="books.html">books</a> about
      humane and effective ways of dog training.

      Mind Games: Getting a rebel doggy back in control

    <p>
      The <a href=

      Games</a>, by <a href="http://www.shirleychong.com/">M. Shirley
      Chong</a>, are a series of simple tactics you can apply if your
      doggy has somehow began to think he's the one who rules your
      home. You can apply them selectively or all at once. Some
      trainers say that it's good to apply them on every dog every once
      in a while. There's a <a href=
      "juegos_mentales.html">translation</a> of the Mind Games article
      to Spanish <a href="juegos_mentales.html">right here</a> (hay una

      The Volhard Motivational Method
    </h3>
    <p>
      The <a href="http://www.volhard.com/training/vmm.htm">Volhard
      Motivational Method</a> is "an approach to training for people
      who like their dogs and who have them first and foremost as pets
      and companions. At the heart of the Motivational Method is the
      conviction that <b>positive reinforcement</b> is the most
      effective teaching tool. By <b>rewarding the correct
      response</b>, the dog is motivated to learn and training is made
      pleasant for both handler and dog."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Volhards have published several books and videos, and they
      promote a <a href=
      "http://www.volhard.com/holistic/artbywv.htm">holistic feeding
      program</a> for dogs [this should go in a "health" section, I
      guess. JA].

    <p>
      "The <a href="http://www.behavior.org/">Cambridge Center's</a>
      mission is to help people find effective solutions to behavior
      problems. In essence, the Center is a connecting link between the
      research community and society, seeking to bridge this gap by
      sponsoring activities that disseminate and interpret behavioral
      research findings for the benefit of those in society whose
      problems involve human behavior &#8211; parents, teachers,
      doctors, counselors, judges, engineers, and corporate
      executives."
