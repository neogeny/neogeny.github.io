    <p>
      Dejav&#250; is our Golden Retriever. He was born on April 6,
      2002.
    </p>
    <p>
      We called him Dejav&#250; because we knew he was the one as soon
      as we saw him.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are the books about dog behavior that I've read since we
      got Dejav&#250;. The list is more-or-less in the order I read
      them. I'll be writing comments about each of the books as time
      permits..
    </p>
    <p>
      You can click on the links or images to go to the book entries at

    <h2>
      A Bit of Advice (Just two pennies worth of it)
    </h2>
    <p>
      I read most of these books in a very short period of time (before
      Dejav&#250; was six months old), so it was somewhat easier for me
      to compare them. The impression I got is that the contents of
      most doggy books can be classified like this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Information</b> about things like dog physical and emotional
        development, character, personality, and health.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Advice,</b> mostly about how to train dogs, a good part of
        that about how to deal with "problem behavior", and the other
        part about how to deal with health issues, like feeding
        regimes, grooming, neutering and spaying, or dealing with
        emergencies.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I found that most of the <b>information</b> was consistent among
      the books, and I think that what is consistent throughout you can
      take almost for granted. For example, you can assume as true that
      chocolates and onions are poisonous for your dog, that dogs
      finish growing by the year but take longer to mature physically
      and emotionally, that doggy societies have very well defined
      hierarchies, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also found some areas for which information differed among the
      books, or was outright contradictory. To resolve those
      inconsistencies and contradictions, I think it's better to seek
      more authoritative references or professional advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrast, I found that the <b>advice</b> part varied widely
      (and wildly) among books. Books on operant conditioning, positive
      reinforcement and clicker training propose a
      let-the-dog-figure-it-out, no-lures, no-force, and
      <b>no-punishment</b> approach to dog training, while different
      books suggest luring, forcing, jerking, or <b>slapping</b> as a
      way to get quicker results. The advice about feeding also varies
      plenty, with some books suggesting that quality kibble is fine,
      others promoting that only home-cooked doggy meals work, and yet
      others suggesting that only a diet of raw, meaty bones will do
      the trick. The same goes for ways of dealing with special
      situations and problem behaviors.
    </p>
    <p>
      So many differences and contradictions can only mean that the
      advice in the books should be taken with a grain of salt and
      <b>lots of common sense</b>. It's better to discuss any advise
      with the vet before following it, and it would be good to discuss
      training methods with professional trainers (something you can do
      online) before adopting any. As Paul Loeb says in "Smarter than
      you Think", over time, <b>you</b> should be the one who best
      communicates with your dog and the one who knows more about his
      overall state of health.
    </p>
    <p>
      My own piece of advice is this: If your vet doesn't seem to know
      the answer to your questions, or dismisses them without much
      argument, it would be a good idea to seek the advice of a
      different vet, at least for matters regarding the everyday care
      of your dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same goes for professional dog trainers. If your trainer
      won't answer questions about the pros and cons of different
      training methods, or about how his method addresses the areas in
      which other methods excel; if you just don't feel comfortable
      with the way the trainer treats your dog, or about the way the
      dog is responding to the training, the common sense thing to do
      would be to get an opinion from a different trainer.
    </p>

             A Complete Guide to the Care and Training of Dogs of All
            Breeds</a><br>
             by Lee Duncan 
            <p>
              I inherited a copy of this book from my grandfather, who
              used to breed German Shepherds. It was my first book
              about dogs. This 1958 classic is probably one of the
              first books to endorse a humane way of relating to our
              four-legged companions. In the words of <a href=
              "http://www.rintintin.org/train.html">Lee Duncan:</a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                "As Rinty's teacher I have always tried first of all to
                keep his love and respect. I want to be half the man
                Rin thinks I am."
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              The book covers everything from feeding regimens, health
              and development, and how to deal with emergencies, to
              breeding and, of course, training. It's hard to believe
              but, modern trends about conscious dog care and humane
              training are already there in this 1958 book.
            </p>
            <p>
              The book is written in an very light style -- one
              probably aimed at a young audience -- so it should be a
              very easy read for anyone. Used copies can be found here
              and there, even on the <a href=

            Other End of the Leash<br>
            </a> by Patricia McConnell 
            <p>
              In this book, zoologist, dog behaviorist and trainer Dr.
              Patricia McConnell discusses the characteristic behavior
              of canines (like dogs) and primates (like humans), their
              few similarities, and their many differences. This book
              is about understanding both dogs and ourselves with the
              aim of improving the communication and relationships
              between humans and dogs.
            </p>
            <p>
              An important part of the book is devoted to explaining
              behaviorist theories about how animals (including humans)
              learn. The topics cover operant conditioning and the
              effects of positive and negative reward and punishment in
              the learning process.
            </p>
            <p>
              The book is also full of nice stories drawn from Dr.
              McConnell's experience as a dolphin and dog trainer, and
              as a dog behaviorist specializing in problem dogs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though this is not in any way a step by step training
              guide, it's still among my favorite books about dog
              training. Knowing something about how dogs behave by
              nature, about how our own behavior (even the unconscious
              one) can affect that, and about the processes and tools
              of learning is an important step in developing a training
              strategy that is at the same time effective, humane, and
              fun.

            </a> by Clarice Rutherford, David H. Neil<br>
             
            <p>
              This would be your standard book about dog care and
              training using positive reinforcement and common sense if
              it wasn't for it's exceptional discussion about dog
              development stages. This book explains the physical and
              behavioral changes a puppy goes through during it's first
              year of life on a week by week basis.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a book that should interest anyone raising a
              puppy. It's very reassuring to know that your puppy is
              not dumb or "out to get you" but that it may be just
              going through a specific, troublesome period of its
              puberty. Such knowledge is good for the physical and
              psychological health of both dog and owner. It's also
              good to be reminded that sometimes dog misbehavior is due
              to a passing develomental stage, and that patience,
              consistency, and assertiveness is what pays out on the
              long run.

            <p>
              Tom Longsdale explains the prevalence of periodontal
              disease in dogs (as much as 80% of chronic serious
              cases), about it's nasty effect of on a dog's health and
              longevity, and about how empirical evidence demonstrates
              the influence of inadequate diets (particularly those
              based on commercial food) on the development of the
              disease. The book recommends a diet based on raw meaty
              bones and whole small-animal carcasses as the way to
              avoid periodontal disease and generally contribute to a
              dog's overall health.

              This sixteen page booklet contains all the advice needed
              to raise a dog that is well mannered and a good family
              member. The booklet talks about the things that many dog
              owners will likely learn by themselves from observation,
              experimentation, and application of common sense (like
              using body language and body blocks, using attention as a
              reward, and never playing wrestling games with dogs!),
              but it's wonderful to have all that knowledge
              concentrated in just a few pages written in the
              authoritative and easy-to-read style of Dr. Patricia
              McConnel.

              This is a reference book. I've already used it, but I
              probably won't read it all. I'll comment on it after I've
              used it a few more times.

             Deepening our relationship with dogs.</a><br>
             by Suzanne Clothier 
            <p>
              This book changed my views about dog training, or thather
              it confirmed my intuitions and set them in stone. This is
              a book about the feelings in the dog-human relationships
              that makes us want to have a dog, and take care of it
              during its shorter-than-human lifetime.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since I read this book I abandoned systematic ways of
              training, and started treating my dog as the canine
              member of the family. We still do some click-training,
              but we do it mostly for fun.

              Turid Rugaas wrote a little pamphlet called "On Talking

              Suzanne Clothier has a pamphlet called "Body [Posture]
              and Emotions." Haven't read it, but she is absolutely
              brilliant so I can't imagine it being bad."

            Language: An Encyclopedia of Canine Behavior</a><br>

            <p>
              I got Roger Abrantes' book "Dog Language - an
              Encyclopedia of Canine Behaviour" several years ago to
              help me better my shy dogs body language better. Now I
              have a very confident feisty puppy I have been ben
              referring to it again, as her postures are so different!
            </p>
            <p>
              He has lots of black and white illustrations of dog
              posture and facial expressions. The first brief section
              is titled "The Evolution of Canine Social Behaviour". The
              main body of the book is a description and explainaton of
              about 300 doggy terms, in alphabetic order. Each with
              cross references to any other pertinent terms in the
              book.
            </p>
            <p>
              It covers the most common dog body language, and it is
              the only book on the subject I have seen. I should think
              this subject,as it is mostly a change in posture over
              time, is difficult to describe properly in a book.
