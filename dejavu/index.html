      <h1>Dejav&uacute; </h1>
      <p>Dejav&uacute; is our Golden Retriever. He was born on April 6, 2002. </p>
      <p>We called him Dejav&uacute; because we knew he was the one as soon as we saw 
      him. </p>
      <p>Dejav&uacute; escaped from home running away from fireworks on early December 
      2003. Despite all our efforts, we couldn't find him and, although he 
      carried his badge, he was never returned. We, his family, hope that 
      whomever who has him treats him with as much love as he deserves.</td>
