<p>(This section is not part of the Open Source Definition.)</p>

<p>We think the Open Source Definition captures what the great majority
of the software community originally meant, and still mean, by the
term "Open Source".  However, the term has become widely used and
its meaning has lost some precision.  The <strong>OSI
Certified</strong> mark is OSI's way of certifying that the license
under which the software is distributed conforms to the OSD; the
generic term "Open Source" cannot provide that assurance, but we
still encourage use of the term "Open Source" to mean conformance to
the OSD.  For information about the <strong>OSI Certified</strong>
mark, and for a list of licenses that OSI has approved as conforming
to the OSD, see the OSD <a href="/docs/certification_mark.php">Certification Mark page</a>.</p>

<h1>The Open Source Definition</h1>

	<p>Version 1.9</p>

	<blockquote>

	<font size="-1">

<p><i>The indented, italicized sections below appear as annotations to the
Open Source Definition (OSD) and are <b>not</b> a part of the OSD. A plain
version of the OSD without annotations can be found
<a href="definition_plain.php">here</a>.</i></p>
<p><i>A printable version of this annotated page is available <a href="http://opensource.org/docs/def_print.php">here</a></i>.
</font>

</blockquote>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Open source doesn't just mean access to the source code. The
distribution terms of open-source software must comply with the
following criteria:

<a name="1"><H3>1. Free Redistribution</H3></a>

<p>The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the
software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing
programs from several different sources. The license shall not require a
royalty or other fee for such sale.</p>

<blockquote>

<font size="-1">

<p><i><b>Rationale:</b> By constraining the license to require free
redistribution, we
eliminate the temptation to throw away many long-term gains in order
to make a few short-term sales dollars.  If we didn't do this, there
would be lots of pressure for cooperators to defect.</i>

</font>

</blockquote>

<a name="2"><H3>2. Source Code</H3></a>

<p>The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in
source code as well as compiled form. Where some form of a product is
not distributed with source code, there must be a well-publicized
means of obtaining the source code for no more than a reasonable
reproduction cost&#150;preferably, downloading via the Internet without
charge.  The source code must be the preferred form in which a
programmer would modify the program. Deliberately obfuscated source
code is not allowed. Intermediate forms such as the output of a
preprocessor or translator are not allowed.</p>

<blockquote>
<font size="-1">

<p><i><b>Rationale:</b> We require access to un-obfuscated source code because
you can't evolve
programs without modifying them.  Since our purpose is to make
evolution easy, we require that modification be made easy.</i></p>

</font>

</blockquote>

<a name="3"><H3>3. Derived Works</H3></a>

<p>The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow
them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original
software.</p>

<blockquote>

<font size="-1">

<p><i><b>Rationale:</b> The mere ability to read source isn't enough to support
independent
peer review and rapid evolutionary selection.  For rapid evolution to
happen, people need to be able to experiment with and redistribute
modifications.</i></p>

</font>

</blockquote>

<a name="4"><H3>4. Integrity of The Author's Source Code</H3></a>

<p>The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified
form <em>only</em> if the license allows the distribution of "patch files" with
the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time.
The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from
modified source code. The license may require derived works to carry a
different name or version number from the original software.</p>

<blockquote>

<font size="-1"><p><i><b>Rationale:</b> Encouraging lots of improvement is a good thing, but
users have a
right to know who is responsible for the software they are using.
Authors and maintainers have reciprocal right to know what they're
being asked to support and protect their reputations.</i></p>

<p><i>Accordingly, an open-source license <b>must</b> guarantee that
source be readily available, but <b>may</b> require that it be
distributed as pristine base sources plus patches.  In this way,
"unofficial" changes can be made available but readily distinguished
from the base source.</i></p>

</font>

</blockquote>

<a name="5"><H3>5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups</H3></a>

<p>The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.</p>


<blockquote>

<font size="-1">

<p><i><b>Rationale:</b> In order to get the maximum benefit from the process,
the maximum
diversity of persons and groups should be equally eligible to
contribute to open sources.  Therefore we forbid any open-source
license from locking anybody out of the process.</i></p>

<p><i>Some countries, including the United States, have export restrictions
for certain types of software.  An OSD-conformant license may warn
licensees of applicable restrictions and remind them that they are
obliged to obey the law; however, it may not incorporate such
restrictions itself.</i></p>

</font>

</blockquote>

<a name="6"><H3>6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor</H3></a>

<p>The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in
a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program
from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.</p>

<blockquote>

<font size="-1">

<p><i><b>Rationale:</b> The major intention of this clause is to prohibit
license traps
that prevent open source from being used commercially.  We want
commercial users to join our community, not feel excluded from it.</i></p>

</font>

</blockquote>

<a name="7"><H3>7. Distribution of License</H3></a>

<p>The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program
is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license
by those parties.</p>

<blockquote>

<font size="-1">

<p><i><b>Rationale:</b> This clause is intended to forbid closing up software by
indirect means
such as requiring a non-disclosure agreement.</i></p>

</font>

</blockquote>

<a name="8"><H3>8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product</H3></a>

<p>The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's being
part of a particular software distribution. If the program is extracted
from that distribution and used or distributed within the terms of the
program's license, all parties to whom the program is redistributed should
have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the
original software distribution.</p>

<blockquote>

<font size="-1">

<p><i><b>Rationale:</b> This clause forecloses yet another class of license
traps.</i></p>

</font>

</blockquote>

<a name="9"><H3>9. The License Must Not Restrict Other Software</H3></a>

<P>The license must not place restrictions on other software that is
distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the
license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the
same medium must be open-source software.</P>

<blockquote>

<font size="-1">

<p><i><b>Rationale:</b> Distributors of open-source software have the right to
make their own choices about their own software.</i></p>

<p><i>Yes, the GPL is conformant with this requirement.  Software linked
with GPLed libraries only inherits the GPL if it forms a single
work, not any software with which they are merely distributed.</i></p>

</font>

</blockquote>

<a name="10"><h3>*10. The License must be technology-neutral</h3></a>

<p>No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual
technology or style of interface.</p>

<blockquote>
<font size="-1">
<p><i><b>Rationale:</b> This provision is aimed specifically at licenses
which require an explicit gesture of assent in order to establish
a contract between licensor and licensee. Provisions mandating
so-called "click-wrap" may conflict with important methods of
software distribution such as FTP download, CD-ROM anthologies,
and web mirroring; such provisions may also hinder code re-use.
Conformant licenses must allow for the possibility that (a)
redistribution of the software will take place over non-Web
channels that do not support click-wrapping of the download, and
that (b) the covered code (or re-used portions of covered code)
may run in a non-GUI environment that cannot support popup
dialogues.
</i></p></font></blockquote>
