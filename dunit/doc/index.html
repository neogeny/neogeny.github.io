             <small>An Xtreme testing framework for Borland Delphi
            programs</small></h1>

            <p>You probably got here through my article in <a href= 
            "http://community.borland.com/">Borland Community
            Developer News</a>. If not, and you want to know what
            this is all about, you can read the article <a href= 
            "/juanca/writings/1999-11-29.html">here</a>.</p>

            <p>DUnit is an Xtreme testing framework for Borland
            Delphi programs. It was inspired on (actually almost
            cloned from) the <a href= 
            "http://www.xprogramming.com/software.htm">JUnit</a>
            framework written in Java by Kent Beck and Erich Gamma.
            You can read all about Xtreme Testing and Extreme
            Programming from <a href=
            "http://www.xprogramming.com/">this site</a>.</p>

            <p>The current version of DUnit is 3.2.2. See the
            <a href="#Log">Log</a> below for the latest changes.

            <h2><a name="Contributing">Contributing</a></h2>

            <p>If you want to contribute to improving DUnit, please
            <a href="mailto:juanco@suigeneris.org">drop me a
            note</a> just to make sure no amount of work gets
            duplicated. Right now, the work remaining to do in
            DUnit is:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Translate JUnit's excellent documentation and
              examples to Delphi.</li>

              <li>Improve the framework so the user can select the
              tests to run using the GUI test runner.</li>

              <li>Provide a way of logging the results of test runs
              and optionally rerunning only the failed test
              cases.</li>

              <li>Package the framework in binary form so it's
              ready for use.</li>

              <li>Whatever you come up with...</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><a name="Contributors">Contributors</a></h2>

            <ul>
              <li>Kent Beck and Erich Gamma developed the original
              testing frameworks in Smalltalk and Java.</li>

              <li>Juanco A&ntilde;ez &lt;<a href= 
              "mailto:juanco@suigeneris.org">mailto:juanco@suigeneris.org</a>
              &gt; did the port to Borland Delphi and provided the
              collections library.</li>

              <li>Mark Watts &lt;mwatts at taxwise dot com&gt;
              provided a fix that let DUnit compile under Delphi
              5.</li>

              <li>Tres Seaver &lt;tseaver at palladion dot com&gt;
              provided a component-based DUnit implementation.</li>

              <li>Harley Pebley &lt;Harley at medicalpriority dot
              com&gt; updated the source comments to make them
              compatible with Time2Help, and provided a Help file
              created with the tool.</li>

              <li>Chris Morris &lt;ChrisM at SNELLINGCORP dot
              COM&gt; has provided several enhancements and bug
              fixes.</li>

              <li>Andrew McIntyre &lt;bgc at m140 dot aone dot net
              dot au&gt; wrote AutoDUnit.pas, a registry for

            <h2><a name="Download">Download</a></h2>

            <p>You should read the <a href="LICENSE.html">
            license</a> before you download the software. The
            complete source code is <a href="dunit-3.2.2.zip">
            here</a>. The current version is 3.2.2. DUnit works
            with Delphi v 4 and later.</p>

            <p>As it stands, DUnit is vary lacking on
            documentation. If you can read Java code, then you can
            get along by reading the documentation that comes with
            JUnit.</p>

            <p>You can also download <a href="DUnit_PEM.zip">
            DUnit_PEM</a>, Tres Seavers's component-based version
            of DUnit. DUnit_PEM uses a more traditional Delphi /
            component approach (i.e., use Properties / Events /
            Methods, rather than Interfaces / Inheritance). This
            allows easy integration of the test framework into the
            Delphi IDE -- test suites, cases, and results are
            simple non-visual components. Some variation along
            these lines might usefully backport to Java for
            integration into an EJB environment (which uses
            essentially the same P/E/M model, borrowed from
            Delphi). DUnit_PEM is freely distributable open source.

                  <p>Moved the msg strings in ITestCase.assertXXX methods to
                  the end, made them default parameters with empty string values,
                  and removed the non-message versions of the methods. These 
                  changes cut the interface roughly to half, and provide 
                  for a more Delphi-like way of doing things. The changes will
                  break some existing code, but the fixes are very easy.</p>
                  <p>
                  Added assertEquals and asserNotEquals methods that accept
                  native strings to TTestCase, as by suggestions made by Chris
                  Morris.

                  <p>
                  Incorporated the Makefile used to package the distribution
                  zip file to the distribution.

                    Added the ability to enable/disable tests or

                    different colors for tests that run, suceeded,
                    failed or produced an error.

                  <td valign="top">
                    Added many of the improvements in JUnit 3.1 to
                    DUnit, including: 

                    <ul>
                      <li>Added an ITestListener interface that
                      clients implement to receive information
                      about the progress of a test run, and
                      reimplemented the text and GUI versions of
                      the test runners to use it.</li>

                      <li>You can use testSuitOf(TTestCaseClass) to
                      automatically generate a test suite out of
                      its&nbsp; published testXXX methods.</li>

                      <li>The TTestCase.suite class method returns
                      a test suite built using testSuiteOf().</li>

                      <li>TTestSuites can have names.</li>

                      <li>The GUI now displays a tree with the
                      tests being run.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Other changes were:</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Moved the test case registration routines
                      into DUnit.pas.</li>

                      <li>Added helper routines (like
                      RunRegisteredTests) so tests can be run more
                      easily.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Completely refactored teh collections
                    library used by DUnit to make it more useful in
                    other projects. Enhancements include:</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>ISortedSet and ISortedMap implemented as
                      red/black trees in TTreeSet and
                      TTreeMap.</li>

                      <li>All the interfaces and classes were
                      placed into a single Collections.pas
                      unit.</li>

                      <li>Contained objects don't necessarilly have
                      to implement IObject. The library will behave
                      reasonable with any IUnknown.&nbsp;</li>

                    <p>Incorporated bug fix from Chris Morris. Due
                    to the way Delphi implements interfaces,
                    TTestSuite could not be cast to ITest. Trying
                    create suites of suites produced an error. This
                    is now fixed.</p>
