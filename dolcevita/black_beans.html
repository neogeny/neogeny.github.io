      Black beans are a typical dish in all countries in and around the
      Caribbean: the islands, M&eacute;xico, Central America, and the
      North of South America. They're a favorite because they're
      delicious, they can be prepared to accompany many foods or as
      main dish, they taste great when prepared in advance, and they're
      very nutritious.
    </p>
    <p>
      This recipe describes my favorite way of preparing black beans.
      Some variations are described at the end.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Ingredients for 4 people
    </h3>
    <p>
      1 pound of black beans
    </p>
    <h2>
      Cleaning
    </h2>
    <p>
      The harvesting process may leave small sticks or stones in black
      beans. Be sure remove them, specially the stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take a handful of beans at a time, lay the beans flat on the
      table, and remove any strange objects, as well as any split or
      deformed beans.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Soaking
    </h2>
    <p>
      Black beans are tough beans, so they usually require plenty of
      cooking, more so the more the beans have been in storage. Rather
      than cooking the beans indefinitely, or use a pressure cooker
      (which is known may become a WMD when combined with black beans),
      I prefer to soak the beans in water for several hours before
      starting the actual cooking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black beans may be soaked for just a couple of hours, overnight,
      or from early morning till afternoon. The more they're soaked the
      less the cooking that will be required. Soaking has the
      additional advantage that, unlike the cooking, it can be done
      unattended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Place the clean black beans on a bowl that can hold at least
      double the volume of the beans. Fill the bowl with water, and let
      it rest for at least two hours. If left to soak long enough, the
      beans will absorb most or all of the water.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Cooking
    </h2>
    <p>
      Drain the soaked beans discarding any remaining liquid, wash them
      with running water, and place them in a tall cooking pot that can
      hold at least double the volume of the beans. Add water to cover
      twice the volume of the beans, and turn on the heat to max. After
      the liquid starts boiling, lower the heat until you get a simmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cook the black beans stirring every once in a while until they
      are tender, but not so tender that they start loosing their skins
      or breaking. This shouold take about two hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always keep the liquid level a little above the beans by adding
      one cup of water at a time when needed. You can let the liquid
      reduce after the beans are done.
    </p>
    <p>
      To know when the beans are done, byte one. The beans, when done,
      should be "al dente", that is, in one piece, shiny black on the
      outside, and white and soft on the inside. The remaining liquid
      should have become very black and creamy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason why so much attention is required for cooking black
      beans is because the tenderness/toughness of black beans varies
      widely. To be cooked to the right point, they require being
      looked after throughout.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Seasoning
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Salt
    </h3>
    <p>
      Add salt to taste, and you already have a black bean dish.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Syrup
    </h3>
    <p>
      The flavor of black beans becomes more characteristic and intense
      when sugar is added. I use sugar-cane syrup when available, but
      plain sugar works too. You can experiment with whatever syrup you
      have at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Add a spoonful of syrup to the black beans, stir, and taste,
      until you feel their flavor intensify. Stop before there's the
      smallest hint of sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more, you have a delicious and ready black bean dish.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Olive Oil
    </h3>
    <p>
      Olive oil is of European origin, so its not really part of
      traditional American black bean dishes. But olive oil does
      wonders to black beans. I may have gotten this idea from one of
      my European family members.
    </p>
    <p>
      Add a swirl of olive oil to the black beans before serving them,
      or place the olive oil on the table so people can help
      themselves.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Spices
    </h3>
    <p>
      I've found that a pinch of freshly ground coriander or nutmeg
      combines marvelously with black beans. I always add some black
      pepper. You may experiment with any of the "sweet" spices.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Seasoning
    </h3>
    <p>
      Coarsely chop several cloves of garlic, and about half a cup of
      bell peppers and onions. Saut&eacute; in a little olive oil over
      medium heat until the garlic starts changing color. Stir the mix
      into the black beans an cook for a few minutes before serving.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Variations
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Moors and Christians
    </h3>
    <p>
      The intense taste of black beans goes very well with white rice,
      and that's how black beans are traditionally served throughout
      the Caribbean. The best white rice is the one cooked "French
      style".
    </p>
    <p>
      Black beans and white rice is called "Moors and Christians" in
      Cuba and other Northern Caribbean islands.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Pork
    </h3>
    <p>
      As with other kinds of beans, all sorts of pork go great with
      black beans. You can serve the pork as a separate dish, our you
      can chop it into bite sized pieces, pre-cook it, and add it to
      the simmering beans before they're done. Smoked ribs, and all
      kinds of spicy sausages work great.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Sweet Black Beans
    </h3>
    <p>
      Black beans are delicious at all degrees of sweetness, from
      plain, to very sweet (some people like them very sweet only, so
      they always add sugar to the black beans on the table). You may
      vary the degree of sweetness of black beans to suit the dishes
      you're serving them with. For example, if you're serving meat
      with a spicy or hot sauce, you may serve sweet black beans to
      provide contrast and relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are Japanese recipes for black bean ice cream, and sweet
      black bean filled buns.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Refritas
    </h3>
    <p>
      Leftover black beans taste great. The beans will continue to
      absorb water when placed in the fridge, and reheating them will
      make the mix much thicker than when the beans where originally
      prepared. Use a saut&eacute;ing pan to reheat leftover black
      beans. Cook until you get the texture you want. Reheated leftover
      black beans are called "caraotas refritas" (refried black beans)
      in Venezuela, and they are a traditional breakfast dish.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Tacos
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mexican recipes use a very pasty version of black beans. To use
      black beans as a filling or topping for bread, buns, etc., you
      need to make them pasty so the beans hold together. Else they
      will easily fall out and escape their wrap.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get pasty black beans, just keep adding liquid to the beans on
      the first preparation. You can also use "refritas" (left over
      black beans), adding liquid only if needed. The more you cook,
      the more the beans will break and become pasty.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Black Bean Soup
    </h3>
    <p>
      To make black bean soup just cook the beans with more water, or
      re-hydrate the beans with water or broth after they're done. Try
      not to overcook the beans so they don't break. Season to taste.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Black Bean Cream
    </h3>
    <p>
      To make black bean cream, just run a black bean soup through the
      blender.
