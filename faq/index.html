            What's this site about?
    </h3>
    <p>
    It's about everything and anything. I (<a href="../juanca/">Juancarlo Añez</a>),
    set up this site so my friends and I could share some of the stuff
    we're interested in.</p>
    <h3>
    Why is this site in English?
    </h3>
    <p>
    My language is Spanish, but only a few of the many people visiting
    this site understand Spanish, but most of them dodo  understand English.</p>
