            The true meaning behind open source licenses
          </h1>
          <p>
            <i>What does all this licensing stuff really mean?</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            I develop software for a living, so my position regarding
            third-party software has always been pragmatic: consider
            the cost and evaluate how well each solution meets your
            requirements. Most open source software is licensed free of
            charge. But does software that is licensed for free really
            have zero cost?
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="http://electriciti.com/1.01/property-wp.html"
            target="_blank">Property rights</a> -- who has the right to
            own what -- are at the ideological core of political
            systems and are one of the fundamental individual liberties
            in a capitalist society. Software is considered a form of
            property by law, so talking about software licenses --
            including open source licenses --&nbsp; in that context
            makes sense.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm not a lawyer, so none of my views or interpretations of
            this matter would necessarily stand up in a court of law.
            Also, I'm talking primarily about United States copyright
            law because the copyright licenses I'll discuss were
            written in the US; the laws of other countries and of the
            international community might be different.
          </p>
          <p>
            Property law establishes three basic rights: the right to
            use, the right to enjoy (profit from), and the right to
            dispose of the property. When dealing with intellectual
            property, and more specifically with copyrighted work such
            as software, such rights are exclusive to the copyright
            owner. Most software licenses explicitly reference the
            right to:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              perform the work -- that is, to execute the software
            </li>
            <li>
              prepare derivative works -- that is, to debug, patch,
              enhance, or otherwise modify the software
            </li>
            <li>
              make copies of the work
            </li>
            <li>
              distribute copies of the work
            </li>
            <li>
              authorize others to exercise the above rights
            </li>
            <li>
              sublicense the software (charge for it)
            </li>
            <li>
              prevent others from exercising the above rights
            </li>
            <li>
              transfer or license the above rights
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            I want to analyze several well-known (and some
            lesser-known) open source licenses in terms of the three
            basic&nbsp; rights property law establishes and the more
            specific rights held by copyright owners. Politics and
            philosophy aside, I want to evaluate what the different
            licenses mean to someone who develops software for a
            living, like me.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            The licenses I'll be considering are those mentioned at the

          <h2>
            In the Public Domain
          </h2>
          <p>
            We should first
            look at one of the most widely used terms in open source
            distribution that has not yet been certified by the Open
            Source Institute: placing the work "in the public domain."
            A work placed in the public domain has the same legal
            status as one for which the legal copyright term (usually
            50 years after the death of all the authors) has elapsed.
            This condition is particularly interesting because the
            rights to use and profit from the work (execute, copy, and
            distribute the software) can be exercised by anyone, yet
            the ultimate right of disposing of the work (the right to
            authorize or restrict other's rights to it) belongs to no
            one and, therefore, cannot be exercised.
          </p>
          <p>
            Software placed in the public domain essentially follows
            the same copyright law as the works of long-dead literary
            and musical authors. You can perform (execute) the works of
            Shakespeare, copy them, and distribute them, but remember
            that derivative works, compilations, and specific
            performances can have their own lawful copyright owners.
            You can include public domain software in your own work,
            modify it, copy it, and talk about it in publications and
            at conferences. You can't do the same with someone else's
            work, however, just because it happens to use or contain
            public domain work. You're otherwise free to derive any
            profits from public domain software.
          </p>
          <p>
            Public domain software is unique in that it is the only
            form of work whose disposal rights are not retained by
            anyone. Every form of software licensing reserves rights 5,
            6, and 7 for some entity, including the right to license
            work under a different scheme whenever desired. From a
            business perspective, it's guaranteed that legal claims of
            copyright violation can not be brought against users of
            software that is in the public domain.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <h2>
            The least restrictive licensing
          </h2>
          <p>
            Software licensing schemes always reserve the right to
            dispose of the work (grant, restrict, transfer, and license
            the rights). This is redundant because licensing can only
            exist if someone holds those basic rights, unlike work
            placed in the public domain. All open source licenses have
            that element in common, but differ in the other rights they
            grant or restrict.
          </p>
          <p>
            The least restrictive form of software licensing is that
            which&nbsp;reserves only the right to disposition. The BSD
            and MIT licenses, for example, grant ample rights of use,
            creation of derivative works, and redistribution (as long
            as the right to dispose of the work is explicitly reserved
            to the original authors). Included is the right to make
            different licensing arrangements with whomever the licensee
            sees fit. The Artistic (Perl) license is somewhat less
            clear in its section 3, which addresses copying and
            modification of the original "package," but does not talk
            about distribution.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Tightening the reins
          </h2>
          <p>
            Most frequently, open source licenses grant ample rights
            for use of the software and creation of derivative works,
            but restrict distribution in some important way. The four
            most common restrictions on distribution are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You may only distribute the software and the
              modifications within your company or institution (an
              aspect the Artistic License).
            </li>
            <li>
              You may only distribute the software and the
              modifications in object (compiled) form as long as some
              value-added is provided (the XML4J commercial license).
            </li>
            <li>
              You may only distribute the software and the
              modifications for free (Artistic License).
            </li>
            <li>
              You must provide the source to all your modifications, or
              otherwise guarantee that users of your software can get
              hold of the source free of charge (the GPL).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These restrictions mainly affect how you profit from the
            intellectual property. The only restrictions made by the
            controversial GPL are restrictions on distribution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Normally, these kinds of licenses don't place restrictions
            on the work created with the software, which gives such
            licenses a broad range of uses. This applies to end-user
            applications -- such as word processors and spreadsheets --
            and to most of the tools used in software development, even
            commercial ones like compilers, libraries, editors, and
            text manipulation and make tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some other licenses place absolute restrictions on
            distribution in order to avoid so-called "forking." As a
            result, most of the enhancements end up in the primary
            source base. But other licenses restrict distribution just
            to maintain control over the software. I've known only a
            few licenses that do this.
          </p>
          <h2>
            The most restrictive licenses
          </h2>
          <p>
            Paradoxically, one of the most restrictive licenses -- the
            GPL -- is very liberal about redistribution rights. Under
            the GPL, you can distribute the original work or its
            derivatives to whomever you like, as long as you make
            readily available the source to the original work, the
            modifications you obtained, and any modifications you made.
            Any licenses you give must also follow the GPL
            restrictions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many source code licenses restrict the use that can be made
            of the software. Such is the case with the Java Community
            Source License, which appears to restrict free use to
            research. Other uses require that compatibility tests be
            made and royalties be paid. Other licenses, like the XML4J
            Evaluation License, restrict the use to that which is
            "lawful and non-commercial." More restrictive licenses
            grant these rights only for a limited period of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some would argue that source licenses that restrict the use
            or the creation of derivative works are not really open
            source. This, however, is the most common form of licensing
            use in academia, which is driving the so-called open source
            movement and is a main provider of useful source code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Surprisingly, licenses that completely prohibit executing
            the software can still be useful. The trend is a new one,
            but I've seen it applied to the source code in books about
            algorithms and coding techniques. These books provide
            source code, but they restrict its use to study purposes
            only. You cannot copy the software, be it directly, by
            optical recognition, or even by typing it in, which
            eliminates any possibility of passing it through a
            compiler, much less executing it.
          </p>
          <h2>
            If the license fits
          </h2>
          <p>
            If all you want to do with a given open source package is
            use it as a tool to produce work separate from the package,
            then most open source licenses will do. Tools like
            compilers and text editors fall into this category.
            Libraries and interpreters might not, so pay attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            For other purposes, choose public domain software. Or, if
            you want to distribute your software commercially but do
            not want to distribute the source to the modifications you
            made, go with a license like the MIT or the BSD. The GPL
            and LPGL are good choices if you don't mind distributing
            your source code.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Licenses like the Java Community Source License are so
            complicated that I'd keep away from the code unless I could
            count on the services of a good lawyer.
          </p>
          <p>
            In all other cases, read carefully and look for the
            following keywords and phrases: use, copy, distribute,
            modify, derivative works, sublicense, and charge. Those
            words and phrases describe the rights that can be claimed
            on copyrighted work, and they will be specifically
            mentioned in documents that grant or restrict them. When in
            doubt, (gulp!) consult a lawyer.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're planning on distributing your own work as open
            source, then I suggest you adopt one of the licenses
            mentioned at the Open Source Institute's web site. I hope
            that my analysis will make the choice easier. These
            licenses have already been reviewed by lawyers and, just as
            important, they are free to use. Licenses can also be
            copyrighted, you know, and not all licenses are open
            source.
