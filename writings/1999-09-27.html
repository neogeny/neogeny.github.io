            <i>What "revolution"? A long-term open source enthusiast
            describes his conversion.</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            Source code has been available for decades, long before the
            so-called "open source revolution" started. I have found
            value in using and writing open source software since I
            first began experimenting with open source solutions to
            critical business problems. It's easy to become paranoid
            about backups after the first important loss of work to a
            system failure. For me it happened while in college, and I
            flunked the project. The next stage of paranoia comes when
            one groks that the precious latest backups will frequently
            have a much lesser value than the backups of previous
            working versions. Such a revelation will motivate most
            programmers to implement some sort of version control and
            backup strategy. At the next stage, one realizes that the
            contents of the version control database are the real
            source, and that what any given source directory contains
            is just a partial image of the whole thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            My early primitive attempts at version control (file
            renaming, directory cloning) eventually led to the
            installation of a commercial version control package:
            Microsoft Delta. Delta was not an ambitious package. It
            lacked many features that other packages advertised, and
            its documentation was lacking in many places. But I had
            received my copy for free by raving about Microsoft in a
            local newspaper, so I decided to give it a shot. Delta
            served my version control needs flawlessly for years until,
            unexpectedly, Microsoft decided to drop the software.
          </p>
          <p>
            "What the heck," I thought. "The software works fine, so
            why not continue to use it unsupported?" But 1995 arrived,
            and with it Windows 95. Delta simply would not cooperate
            with the new 32-bit OS. As the product had been
            discontinued, the only support option provided was a free
            upgrade to SourceSafe, which Microsoft had recently
            acquired. My initial evaluation of SourceSafe left me wary
            of a version control system that would store my source code
            in an undocumented, proprietary binary format. I queried
            the Net (CompuServe at that time) and found out about the
            many problems people were having with SourceSafe. I decided
            to pass on this system and evaluate other commercial
            options.
          </p>
          <p>
            Good version control comes third in a software developer's
            toolbox only because a compiler that produces correct
            output, and libraries that do what they should, are things
            one simply can't live without. After ruling out SourceSafe,
            I bought and evaluated the two most recognized and touted
            version control packages under US$1000. To my surprise,
            both packages were difficult to use and, worse, they failed
            to perform routine tasks on their first day of use. The
            advertised ability to import my Delta files didn't work
            either. Tech support acknowledged the problems, but the
            only solution offered was to wait for the next release "due
            out in a couple of months." That was unacceptable.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the obvious signs of hyperventilation, I decided to stop
            breathing for a while. I realized I would inevitably lose
            my Delta database and, with it, all the whys and hows of
            every version of my software. I decided that the next
            version control package I used would have to rely on a
            database format that was standard, well documented, and
            humanly auditable (plain text). Then I remembered RCS,
            "Revision Control System," the version control system
            bundled with every version of Unix. I found a Windows
            implementation of RCS on the Net in no time, and all the
            tests I performed ran fine. RCS was open source, and I
            could use it for my needs at no charge.
          </p>
          <p>
            RCS's only weakness was its lack of network consciousness;
            this eventually led me to CVS, the Concurrent Versioning
            System. CVS is open source software, it is licensed under
            the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> <a href=
            "http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">General Public
            License</a> and has <a href="http://www.cyclic.com/">Cyclic
            Software</a> as its official maintainer. CVS is very
            network conscious, it supports collaborative (no locks)
            check-ins and check-outs and branching, and is the primary
            version control package used for open source projects all
            over the Net. Most importantly, CVS uses the RCS file
            format, an open specification of version control databases
            held in plain text.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've used CVS for my version control needs for years, and
            it has always performed flawlessly. The free upgrades have
            simplified the installation and made important performance
            improvements. More than once I've queried the CVS source
            code to see how things really work; it helped me implement
            my Java RCS library (open source), which I wrote in order
            to guarantee that I would never lose my version control
            information again.
          </p>
          <p>
            Individual developers may have reasons of their own to
            resist open source, but sometimes it is the best solution
            to a business need. I'm still paranoid about version
            control, so I plan to release my RCS library as open
            source.
