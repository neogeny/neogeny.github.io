            Everybody's talking about the "open software revolution."
            From geek forums like SlashDot to academic journals like
            <i>Communications of the ACM,</i> from the <i>New York
            Times</i> to <i>The Wall Street Journal,</i> everyone is
            saying that there's something important going on.
          </p>
          <p>
            The leaders of the open-source movement argue that their
            way of doing things will change the world of software
            development forever. Detractors question their leadership
            and attack their ideas on business, logical, economic,
            political, sociological, and other grounds. The hubbub is
            rising so fast I've seen good friends worry that
            open-source software may destroy their way of life by
            making it impossible to sell software or write it for hire.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm not at home with the rhetoric of any of the factions.
            I'm not a radical, I'm a programmer. You say you want a
            revolution? You can count me out.
          </p>
          <h2>
            War of the words
          </h2>
          <p>
            Like many programmers, I have used and written open-source
            software for a long time. I'm glad that we now have a
            phrase -- <i>open source -</i>- to describe what we've been
            doing. But I object to narrow definitions that exclude
            workable, time-honored, and popular practices. Now that we
            have a buzzword, people are trying to cram political and
            economic agendas into the term.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are those, for instance, who argue that open-source
            development is the solution to all software development
            problems. But they do so based on information drawn from
            just a few successful projects. Most of the open-source
            projects I have tracked over the past 18 months have been
            cancelled, only to become data points that feed the
            well-known statistics about the high failure rate of
            software projects. Methodologies are a dozen for a penny;
            these projects failed because they never had a feasible
            business plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the opposite corner are those who see the open-source
            movement as a&nbsp; threat to the software industry. Never
            mind that open-source initiatives are law-abiding and --
            because of their open nature -- much less likely to fall
            into the anticompetitive practices that characterize a part
            of our industry. Never mind that thousands of developers
            are gainfully employed on open-source projects. Never mind
            that hundreds of thousands of users entrust their
            businesses to their work. They are convinced that the sky
            is falling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then there's the debate over "free" software.
          </p>
          <p>
            On one side are the developers and activists who believe
            software should not be treated as intellectual property. Or
            that it should be treated like intellectual property, but
            developers should waive their property rights.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other side are people who oppose free software. Some
            because they think it's impractical, and some because the
            initiative seems politically suspect -- too leftish. The
            extreme left has become extremely unpopular in most
            circles, and all of this talk of free software smacks of
            outmoded socialist ideas. As long as those impressions
            persist, I don't see how the free software cause can make
            it to a critical mass of supporters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Intellectual property has been a hairy issue since the
            invention of speech at least, and intense debates about it
            precede the Internet era by centuries. The debates are so
            intense, you have to wonder how any country's founding
            fathers were able to quiet the ruckus long enough to slip
            intellectual-property language into their constitutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shouting's so loud, it's tempting to ignore the
            arguments. But you can't simply ignore the "free" versus
            "proprietary" software debate -- no more than you would
            ignore debates between Republicans and Democrats in the
            U.S. or Greens and Social Democrats in Germany. This debate
            is truly about ideas. It's worthy of your attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is difficult to write about these issues without making
            a contribution to the arguments. But I'm determined: I'm
            not about to take a side on these issues. I do think that
            open-source development will impact software development in
            general, and in an important way. But I think that the
            effect won't be immediate, and it won't be obvious. To know
            what this "revolution" will actually lead to...well, you
            have to wait. My take is that the factions will ultimately
            reconcile.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strip away the rhetoric and it's clear: There is no
            revolution. The ideas being argued and shouted are
            interesting, and important, yes, but their effect will be
            evolutionary. Like always.
          </p>
          <p>
            So don't worry. It will be all right.
