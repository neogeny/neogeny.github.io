            <i>When royalties are out of the question, programmers find
            innovative ways of earning profits, such as providing
            value-added services. New ways of making business out of
            open source are being invented every day.</i>

            "Amateurs!" That's what critics call open-source
            programmers. And sometimes they really mean "hackers":
            those who lack the knowledge and attitude required to do
            the job well. Well, open-source software is <i>open</i>
            after all, and anyone, knowledgeable or not, can take a
            "hack" at it. But the quality of open-source software like
            <a href="http://www.bind.org/" target="_blank">BIND</a> or
            <a href="http://www.sendmail.org/" target=
            "_blank">Sendmail</a> (on which the Internet lives and
            breathes), or of the many components of <a href=
            "http://www.linux.org/" target="_blank">Linux</a>
            distributions, leaves no room for doubt: these guys know
            what they're doing.
          </p>
          <p>
            More frequently, though, the term "amateur" is used in
            contrast to "professional"; it distinguishes those who work
            at something for fun from those who do the job seriously --
            for a living. Last week <a href=
            "/article/images/10550/link%20to%20saint%20crispin's"
            target="_blank">I suggested</a> that those who perceive
            open-source programmers to be mere hobbyists were in for a
            big surprise. Well, surprise!

          </h2>
          <p>
            Many open-source advocates are entrepreneurs. As many of
            you know, open source has already produced its first round
            of <a href=

               target="_blank">Red Hat's</a> initial public offering.
               RedHat assembles and tests the thousands of parts that
               compose a Linux distribution, selling the CDs and
               installation support through retail channels. The
               company also sells support and consulting services to
               <a href=
               "http://www.redhat.com/about/1999/press_compaq2.html"
               target="_blank">corporate</a> Linux users and
               distributors. The RedHat IPO is special in that
               recognized open-source developers had the opportunity to
               get their share of the deal through <a href=
               "http://www.etrade.com/" target="_blank">eTrade's</a>
               online brokering service. Other companies, such as
               <a href="http://www.turbolinux.com/" target=
               "_blank">Turbo Linux</a>, are working eagerly to get on
               the same train as RedHat.

          <p>
            <a href="http://www.valinux.com/" target="_blank">VA
            Research</a> has made it to the end of the rainbow by
            selling pre-configured hardware, as well as support and
            consulting services to help make the most of open-source
            software, especially Linux. VA Research is <a href=

               target="_blank">reportedly</a> one of the
               fastest-growing companies in the US. There are several

            Companies like <a href="http://www.ora.com/" target=
            "_blank">O'Reilly</a> make money selling printed versions
            of open-source documentation, and publications like

               feature articles about Linux and other open-source
               software, profiting from the sale of ad space. Some of
               these publications become desirable acquisitions because
               of their large reading audiences. Such is the case with
               <a href="http://www.linuxtoday.com/" target=

               featuring a collection of Linux news headlines drawn
               from the printed and online press. The business was

            In their own words
          </h2>
          <p>
            "But those are entrepreneurs," you might object. "What
            about the programmers? Are they profiting from open
            source?"
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, I sought a couple of them out for comment. I caught
            Greg Wilkins of <a href="http://www.mortbay.com/"
               target="_blank">Mortbay Consulting Ltd</a>. just before
               he left for a vacation trip. Greg is author of the
               feature-rich and very successful <a href=
               "http://www.mortbay.com/software/Jetty.html" target=
               "_blank">Jetty</a>, an open-source Web, Servlet, and JSP
               server written in Java. (Note: I've contributed both
               code and advice to the development of Jetty.)
          </p>
          <p>
            I asked Greg if Jetty was contributing to his company's
            revenues and, if so, how.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Jetty contributes very little directly to our revenues --
            a few support contracts only. However, there is a big
            payback in terms of our consulting work," he replied.&nbsp;
            "It is a great reference and an excellent introduction to
            our work, and that keeps our down time to a minimum. But
            the big payoff comes from our work on projects&nbsp; using
            Jetty, for which we receive full consulting rates -- in
            London and Sydney, that's 25 to 75 percent higher than
            normal contracting rates."
          </p>
          <p>
            I also asked Greg why he had decided to make Jetty
            open-source, and what had been the net business effects of
            that decision.
          </p>
          <p>
            He told me that he had written Jetty as an entry to the
            original <a href=
            "http://http://infoseek.go.com/?win=_search&amp;sv=M6&amp;ud9=IE5&amp;qt=%22java+programming+contest%22&amp;oq=Java+programming+contest&amp;url=http%3A//www.cse.nd.edu/contest/encoded/&amp;ti='97+ACM+ECR+Programming+Contest%3A+Encoded+announcement&amp;top=17625"
               target="_blank">Java programming contest</a> sponsored
               by <a href="http://www.sun.com/" target=
               "_blank">Sun</a>, and that it had won the Australian
               prize. For a few years his company reserved the rights
               to commercial use. As a consulting company, though, it
               had neither the resources nor the motivation to become
               strongly product-oriented.
          </p>
          <p>
            "We decided that the best way to profit from Jetty was to
            make it as widely used as possible," Greg confided. He said
            this allowed them to get assistance with its maintenance
            and they believed its quality would improve through
            community involvement. Greg added, "And we were right.
            Jetty has easily paid for itself many times over."
          </p>
          <p>
            I also approached Chad Hower of <a href=
            "http://www.pbe.com/" target="_blank">Phoenix Business
            Enterprises</a>, with whom I had recently had an e-mail
            conversation. Chad is the author of the <a href=
            "http://www.pbe.com/SourceWorks/Winshoes/" target=
            "_blank">Winshoes</a> open-source set of Internet
            components for Delphi. I asked Chad the same questions I'd
            asked Greg.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Marketing developer tools is very hard," Chad told me,
            "especially those targeted at single-vendor development
            environments like Delphi. There is easier money to be made
            elsewhere. Winshoes, like other projects of mine, was more
            a product of need and love of programming than anything
            else. There were no good Internet components for Delphi
            when I wrote Winshoes."
          </p>
          <p>
            Chad felt that trying to market Winshoes would have been
            risky. His time, he explained, was better spent at what he
            did best: software development. Having nothing to lose, he
            made Winshoes opensource as an experiment. What has
            happened since has far exceeded his initial expectations.
            Winshoes has brought the company many contract offers, as
            well as frequent requests for Internet consulting work.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Many developers just sit on code like this," Chad
            observed. "I encourage them to make the sources open and
            see what happens. There's nothing to lose, and a lot to
            gain."
          </p>
          <p>
            Greg and Chad are using open source as what some call a
            "loss-leader": something that you give away to enable
            further business opportunities. Along similar lines is
            <a href="http://www.digicool.com/" target="_blank">Digital
            Creations</a>, a "web solutions" company which built its
            success on the full-featured applications server currently
            known as<a href="http://www.zope.org/" target=
            "_blank">Zope</a>. Feeling some growing pains, Digital
            Creations decided to go after a little venture capital.
            Finding an <a href=
            "http://www.verticality.com/Press/DigitalCreations"
               target="_blank">investor</a> was surprisingly easy. Even
               more surprisingly, the investor recommended making the
               flagship product open source. Digital Creations' value,
               he suggested, was its know-how. The company concluded
               that making Zope open source could only open new doors
               for them -- and it did.

          <p>
            But those are all entrepreneurs. They're not programmers,
            are they?
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes and no. Most of the entrepreneurs behind the companies
            I've mentioned <i>are</i> open-source programmers, though
            I'd bet that they currently don't get the chance to hack as
            much as they did in the past. What you really want to know
            about is the guys actually pounding out the code, right?
          </p>
          <p>
            Companies such as RedHat routinely recruit open-source
            programmers to enhance different aspects of Linux. Because
            these enhancements go back into the pool of shared
            open-source code, the direct advantages RedHat gets from
            them are short-lived. The indirect advantages derive from
            participation in the larger market that the enhancements
            help to create. RedHat and others seem to believe that
            these advantages outweigh the costs.
          </p>
          <p>
            O'Reilly funds open-source software and software
            documentation efforts, and hires or contracts open-source
            software developers to serve as writers and technical
            editors. Writing and publishing books of their own is
            another source of income for open-source developers.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of the companies mentioned above have technical
            positions staffed with open-source programmers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not that open-source developers have much trouble landing
            programming jobs. Having your name and e-mail address
            listed in the credits of the Linux kernel, a hardware
            driver, or a file system implementation seems to be a much
            better reference than a well prepared r&eacute;sum&eacute;
            -- you may even skip the cover letter. The jobs that these
            programmers seek and get are frequently compatible with
            their open-source work.
          </p>
          <p>
            And don't rule out <a href=
            "http://www.debian.org/News/1999/19991012" target=
            "_blank">private funding</a> as a source of income. Who
            would <a href=
            "http://www.redherring.com/insider/1999/0505/vc-linuxcare.html"
               target="_blank">give money</a> to a bunch of hackers to
               pound out software that will ultimately be available for
               free? The answer is companies that get more value out of
               open source than what they invest in its sponsorship.
               One such case is the <a href="http://www.apache.org/"
               target="_blank">Apache</a> project, started and still
               funded by a group of Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
               The group wanted an efficient, reliable, and
               cost-effective HTTP server whose development they could
               at least partially control. Universities are also among
               the institutions funding open source; it helps them
               reduce costs, and they benefit academically as
               well.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Last but not least are the cooperative open-source
            initiatives like <a href="http://www.sourcexchange.com/"
            target="_blank">sourceXchange</a> and <a href=
            "http://www.cosource.com/" target="_blank">CoSource</a>.
            These start-ups call themselves "open-source marketplaces."
            They provide an online infrastructure to connect
            open-source programmers with those interested in sponsoring
            open-source projects. Any party -- company or programmer --
            can either propose an open-source project or sponsor one by
            committing a certain amount of money. Programmers respond
            with proposals for the projects they want to take. Ideally,
            the process will result in cooperative funding for
            interesting projects and payment for programmers, all under
            the constant supervision of the marketplace. All software
            produced goes back to the shared pool as open source. It's
            a whole new way of software contracting; we've yet to see
            were it will lead.

            It takes little research to discover that the question is
            not who's making money from open source, but who isn't.
            With royalties out of the question, those involved in
            open-source software have found innovative ways of
            profiting, either by providing some sort of value-added
            services or by making important savings based on open
            source. And new ways of making business out of open source
            are being invented every day.

            "http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/" target="_blank">Eric
            Raymond</a> -- who became well known for his disclosure of
            Microsoft's <a href="http://www.opensource.org/halloween/"
            target="_blank">Halloween documents</a>, and is now famous
            for his analysis of open-source culture in <a href=
            "http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/"
            target="_blank"><i>The</i> <i>Cathedral and The
            Bazaar</i></a> -- has written a <a href=
            "http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/magic-cauldron/"
            target="_blank">new paper</a> analyzing the economics of
            open-source software. In this paper Raymond proposes that
            software is "largely a service industry operating under the
            persistent but unfounded delusion that it is a
            manufacturing industry," and that the "use value" of
            software far exceeds its "sale value," as evidenced by the
            large percentage of software created for in-house use
            versus the very small percentage written to be sold as
            merchandise.

            Some of you may mistrust Raymond's views because he's
            patently within the open-source <a href=
            "http://www.ora.com/catalog/cb/chapter/magic-cauldron.html"
            target="_blank">inner-circle</a>. Perhaps you'll find Steve
            Ballmer, president of Microsoft, more convincing.
            "Literally, if you go out seven to 10 years from now, not
            only our business but every software business will have to
            remake itself into what I call a software service company,"
            Ballmer predicts in a recent <a href=
            "http://www.cnnfn.com/1999/10/14/technology/wires/microsoft_wg/"
               target="_blank">interview</a> with <a href=
               "http://www.cnnfn.com/" target="_blank">CNN
               Financial</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the same interview Ballmer also mentions that Microsoft
            was considering "a modified form of open sourcing" that
            would allow their customers access to some code. This would
            let the customers "try to solve their own problems." (Not
            that Microsoft "customers solving their own problems" is
            anything new.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Is the move away from royalties and into value-added
            software services something fueled by the open-source
            movement? Or does the so-called friction-free economy of
            the Internet have anything to do with it? Will the changes
            only affect programmers involved in commercial software, or
            do corporate programmers also need to re-evaluate their
            situation?
