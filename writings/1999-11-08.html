            <i>Will open source software development be smothered by
            the patents avalanche or help to end it?</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            As <i>Developer News</i> correspondent Constance Petersen
            discussed in her <a href=
            "http://community.borland.com/devnews/article/1,1714,20002,00.html"
               target="_blank">article</a> last week, 5 Nov. was Burn
               All GIFs Day. The protest was organized by a group of
               open-source developers and Webmasters opposed to the way
               Unisys has exercised the patent it holds on the LZW
               compression algorithm used in GIF files. The group
               proposes getting rid of all GIF files and substituting
               files in open graphic file formats such as PNG.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creating Burn All GIFs Day is just one of the actions taken
            by just one of the groups who think that the patent system,
            as it applies to software, is being abused.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another event brought attention to patents last week. As
            <a href=
            "http://news.cnet.com/category/0-1009-200-1426450.html"
            target="_blank">CNET</a> reported, McDonnell Douglas
            received a patent for "windowing," one of the most widely
            used (and intuitively obvious) Y2K problem-fixing
            techniques. The company has handed the patent over to Bruce
            Dickens, the technique's inventor. Dickens's attorney will
            reportedly contact Fortune 500 companies whose programmers
            have employed the patented technique to request payment and
            negotiate licensing terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aren't patent registration and enforcement just business as
            usual? Doesn't the owner of a patent have the <i>right</i>
            to exercise it at will? Yes, of course. But the issues
            related to this news are not about the patent system per
            se. They revolve around the questionable validity of
            specific patents and their effect on software development
            in general -- and especially, perhaps, the development of
            open source software.
          </p>
          <h2>
            The patent purpose
          </h2>
          <p>
            According to the text of most patent legislation, the main
            purpose of the patent system is not to protect inherent,
            abstract rights, but to enhance the common good by
            promoting the advancement of the arts and sciences. The
            system works like this: The government grants inventors
            legal monopolies over specific inventions and helps enforce
            the monopolies. In return, inventors agree to publish the
            details of their inventions and relinquish control over the
            inventions after a specified period of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inventors benefit because the government-enforced monopoly
            gives them a better chance of recouping the expenses they
            incurred while developing their inventions. Society
            benefits because the common pool of useful knowledge is
            constantly augmented, and because everyone has free access
            to inventions after patents expire. Patents are a good
            idea, especially if you consider the consequences of the
            alternative -- inventors trying to keep their inventions as
            secret as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not all patents are good deals for society, and the law
            foresees that. To be awarded a patent, an invention must be
            novel; the inventor must have been the first to invent that
            particular thing or method. It must also be non-obvious,
            meaning the invention can't be a clear extension of
            something that is already known. Granting patents for
            non-novel inventions (prior art) would allow the imposition
            of royalties on methods and practices that have been in
            wide use, even for a long time. Patents for obvious stuff
            -- things that anyone with the right background could have
            invented -- are a bad idea and are therefore not granted.
          </p>
          <p>
            So what's all the fuss? The problem <a href=
            "http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.07/patents_pr.html"
            target="_blank">according to analysts</a>, is that patents
            <i>are</i> being granted in increasingly large numbers for
            obvious and non-novel inventions, which defeats the whole
            purpose of the patent system. The problem is exacerbated
            because, as intellectual property attorney Steven Young
            explained in a recent <a href=
            "http://www.slashdot.org/features/99/10/19/1032254.shtml"
            target="_blank">Slashdot feature</a>, there is no
            reasonable way to protect against patent liability.
            Becoming informed about the millions of patents, even just
            the subset that is relevant to your business, is not at all
            easy. Patents related to very specific areas of knowledge
            number in the tens of thousands. Some conservative
            estimates predict that 100,000 new software patents will be
            granted this year in the United States alone.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Not a target, but a cure
          </h2>
          <p>
            The <a href="http://lpf.ai.mit.edu/" target="_blank">League
            for Programming Freedom</a> site at MIT offers a wealth of
            information about the patents problem and how it affects
            software development. The LPF predictably opposes software
            patents altogether, but the information on its site about
            the use and abuse of patents is interesting even if you
            don't share their views.
          </p>
          <p>
            To protect themselves against the patent avalanche, large
            companies seem to be filing for patents on everything
            imaginable. The strategy is to use patents as legal weapons
            against the dubious patents of others, but this practice is
            only serving to make the problem worse. Patent portfolios
            are being created mainly as a means of defense, but some
            developers have begun to <a href=
            "http://www2.linuxjournal.com/cgi-bin/frames.pl/articles/currents/003.html"
               target="_blank">worry</a> about what could happen to the
               open source movement if companies decide to try to
               enforce their patents -- which exist for Save As
               commands, multicolored option lists, and other code
               elements -- against software projects like Linux.
          </p>
          <p>
            Is that likely? I don't think so. Some of the companies
            that hold large patent portfolios (most notably <a href=
            "http://www.patents.ibm.com/" target="_blank">IBM</a>) have
            already positioned themselves strongly in support of open
            source software, and they're likely to defend open-source
            projects. Because of the open, collaborative nature of
            open-source efforts and the peer-recognition culture behind
            them, many open-source projects maintain detailed logs of
            who did what and when, and where further information about
            the techniques and algorithms used can be found. Those logs
            may be some of the best documented proof of previous art
            that can be used in court to challenge questionable patent
            claims. Open-source software would not become the target of
            the patent craze, but a good part of the cure.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Curbing the craze
          </h2>
          <p>
            The windowing technique patented by McDonnell Douglas
            interprets years expressed in two digits as belonging to
            century 2000 if the value is less than a specific,
            context-dependent threshold. For example, "15" is
            interpreted as "2015" instead of "1915," while "90" is
            interpreted as "1990." Windowing is a popular fix for Y2K
            problems because it is simple to understand and often
            easier to implement than other kinds of fixes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Is the patent on windowing valid? That will be for the
            courts to decide. The U.S. lacks administrative procedures
            to challenge a patent after it has been granted, so the
            issue must be resolved in court.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, companies that have used the windowing technique
            are legally bound to comply with the conditions set forth
            by the patent holder. Abandoning the software or
            implementing a different fix so close to the dreaded Y2K
            date is out of the question. Neither the lack of knowledge
            about a filed patent nor the intention to challenge it is a
            legal basis for infringement. Analysts contacted by CNET
            predict that larger companies will just pay the fees and
            write them off as part of their Y2K compliance expenses,
            but smaller companies may want to fight the patent in
            court.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if the patent on windowing is valid, pursuing its
            enforcement so close to a global death-march deadline seems
            like placing the sword at the throat of someone who's
            already against the wall. It has the sour taste of
            extortion about it. It's far from clear if and how society
            can benefit from patents like this.
          </p>
          <p>
            There's a chance that the Fortune 500 giants will join with
            the smaller companies to try to set legal precedent against
            dubious patents. Maybe Y2K will mark in more than one way
            the beginning of the end of the patent craze.
