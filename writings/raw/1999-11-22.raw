So Microsoft is a monopolistic monster. What are
you going to do, gather the whole village to assault the
castle with hoes and pitchforks? Burn it down with
torches? Get real.</i></p>
        
        <p>James Whales' 1931 movie of Mary Shelley's <a
        href="http://www.filmsite.org/fran.html" target="_blank"><i>Frankenstein</i></a>
        has become an icon of horror cinematography. Fulfilling
        his personal vision, Dr. Frankenstein creates a living
        man (or almost a man). Infusing life into the inanimate,
        the doctor feels a God-like power. &quot;It's alive!
        Aliiive!&quot; he screams, overwhelmed by the ecstasy
        that accompanies creation. But Frankenstein's
        not-quite-human being is intelligent enough to claim a
        larger space in the world than its maker imagined. The
        monster's power makes everyone uncomfortable -- even its
        creator. Power frightens us because the smallest actions
        of the powerful can have large consequences, and their
        mistakes can be devastating. The mistakes of
        Frankenstein's creature, though born of childlike
        naiveté, quickly become too much to bear. As the film
        comes to an end, torch-wielding villagers hunt down the
        monster. The mob sets fire to an old mill where the
        creature is trapped, and there it presumably dies.</p>

        <p>Frankenstein and his creation come to mind when I
        contemplate developers' reactions to Judge Jackson's
        findings of fact in the Microsoft-DOJ antitrust case.
        Having found Microsoft to be a monopoly (a kind of
        monster), the mob has been quick to loudly indict: <i>Tear
        it to pieces! Restrain it permanently! Confine it!
        Destroy it!</i></p>
        <p>Voices of reason have also spoken. In his 11 Nov. <i>Developer
        News</i> <a
        href="http://community.borland.com/devnews/article/1,1714,20063,00.html">article</a>,
        correspondent Jeff Russell maintains that the case
        brought against Microsoft holds little water, and that
        the allegations brought against the company would have
        been better dealt with in civil court, if at all.
        Long-term <a href="http://www.byte.com/" target="_blank"><i>Byte</i></a>
        columnist Jerry Pournelle <a
        href="http://www.byte.com/printableArticle?doc_id=BYT19991108S0001"
        target="_blank">explains</a> why Microsoft's success
        should be credited mostly to its acting smarter and doing
        things better than its competitors, rather than to excess
        of power. <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/pcweek/"
        target="_blank"><i>PC Week</i></a> columnist Peter Coffee
        <a
        href="http://www.zdnet.com/filters/printerfriendly/0,6061,1018027-2,00.html"
        target="_blank">says</a>, &quot;The judge just didn't get
        it.&quot;</p>
        <p>Judging from the results of polls like the one at <a
        href="http://www.vote.com/vResults/index.phtml?voteID=237932"
        target="_blank">vote.com</a>, and from most of the
        &quot;talkback&quot; messages posted in reply to the past
        two weeks' news, it would seem that Microsoft never did
        anything wrong -- or that whatever it did, government
        intervention isn't merited.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On the other hand, you might base your opinion on the
        anti-Microsoft sentiment that has sparked and grown in
        the past 10 years. How did the company start getting
        nicknames like &quot;Microslop&quot; and &quot;M$&quot;
        in developer circles?</p>
        <p>So Microsoft is a monster. What does one do with a
        monster? What is the reasonable response? How should the
        company itself view its actions? What is the role of the
        development community? What does the whole issue seem to
        predict for the future? Obviously, such questions can't
        even be considered from the perspective of an angry,
        frightened mob.</p>
        <h2>The monster's blunders</h2>
        <p>It takes no more than a quick scan of the Web to
        gather a list of allegations against Microsoft. Consumer
        advocates Ralph Nader and James Love have compiled a
        series of documents related to <a
        href="http://www.essential.org/antitrust/microsoft/"
        target="_blank">Microsoft's anticompetitive conduct</a>.
        The Web also provides many links to the proceedings of
        trials brought against Microsoft for anticompetitive
        behavior; those brought by <a
        href="http://java.sun.com/lawsuit/82198unfair.html"
        target="_blank">Sun</a> and by <a
        href="http://www.calderathin.com/fullstory/vaporwre.html"
        target="_blank">Caldera</a> are two. Microsoft is cited
        in examples of anticompetitive practices in a couple of
        university courses on <a
        href="http://courses.ncsu.edu/CSC379/lectures/Lecture_15.html"
        target="_blank">ethics and computing</a>. According to
        these and other articles, documents, Web pages, and
        online discussions, Microsoft has indulged in such
        nefarious practices as: <a
        href="http://www.csn.net/~bediger/nt.sekrits.html"
        target="_blank">hiding</a> and using to its advantage the
        undocumented, simpler, and more efficient native system
        API in Windows NT; preannouncing nonexistent products to
        discourage consumer purchases of rival goods (<a
        href="http://www.calderathin.com/fullstory/vaporwre.html"
        target="_blank">vaporware</a>); avoiding or <a
        href="http://java.sun.com/lawsuit/82198unfair.html"
        target="_blank">sabotaging</a> open and semi-open
        standards; creating <a

        Hell</a>; delivering <a

        target="_blank">badly designed software</a>; and much
        more.</p>
        <h2>Dr. Frankenstein's dues</h2>
        <p>In his article &quot;<a
        href="http://www.around.com/microsoft.html"
        target="_blank">Making Microsoft safe for capitalism</a>,&quot;
        journalist James Gleick interviews several industry
        leaders about their opinions on Microsoft. Among those
        queried is Mitchell Kapor, who was founder and CEO of
        Lotus Development Corp., the company that produced the
        best-selling Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet application.
        According to the article, Kapor thinks Microsoft has
        &quot;thin ethics.&quot; Kapor says:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Anything not a direct lie or clearly illegal is OK
            to do and should be done if it advances Microsoft's
            tribal cause. This licenses the worst sorts of
            manipulations, lies, tortured self-justifications,
            and so on. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Yet in the same article, Gleick suggests that it is
        not the company's practices that have sparked the
        anti-Microsoft sentiment, but the perpetrator itself:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Microsoft is hardly alone, of course; plenty of
            its competitors would play as rough, if they only
            could. Others in the industry suggest that
            Microsoft's small-company scrappiness has kept it
            from facing the issue of corporate ethics. Behavior
            that people will forgive, or at least understand, in
            a start-up looks considerably less attractive when
            David grows into Goliath. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It's not only what the monster does that incites us;
        it's what the monster is. But can we really expect
        integrity from a monster? Monster authority Joe Sena,
        Deaditor-In-Grief of <a
        href="http://www.horroronline.com/" target="_blank">Universal's
        Online Horror Channel</a>, writes in his June 1998 <a
        href="http://www.universalstudios.com/horror/june98/deaditorial.html"
        target="_blank">deaditorial</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Just what kind of vows do [monsters] take, anyway
            -- &quot;Until dissection or torch-wielding mob do we
            [sic] part&quot;? Or do sequels render such finality
            moot?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Should monsters be accountable for what monsters do?
        Sure. But shouldn't their creators accept part of the
        blame? &quot;Let's go after Bill Gates!&quot; Many would
        rally to the cry. But what about all the managers who've
        said, &quot;You can't go wrong choosing Microsoft&quot;?
        Or the programmers who've rationalized, &quot;Clients
        want VB (VC++, MFC, COM), so that's what I give
        them&quot;? What about the unimaginative computing
        companies and their &quot;do-what-Microsoft-does&quot;
        ways? What about the millions of users protesting,
        &quot;But my friend can't read my documents if they're
        not from Microsoft Word&quot;? It's a monster all right,
        but we have all helped create it.</p>
        <h2>The face in the mirror</h2>
        <p>According to the script, this is the point where I
        declare the verdict. What penalty do I think the court
        should impose against Microsoft's recurrent abuses? No
        penalty. Nothing at all. Leave Microsoft alone. <i>Ignore
        it. </i>Microsoft succeeded in an industry that has been
        continuously inventing itself for the past 20 years. It
        succeeded where better-established companies that had
        started on a better footing fared worse, or even failed.
        What good is a computer on every desk if people can't
        exchange letters and spreadsheets? In a world begging for
        data and usability standards, Microsoft provided them:
        its own. After all, as far as standards are concerned,
        there can be only one.</p>
        <p>For the U.S. government to act against Microsoft in
        court would be like taking the guillotine to our own
        creation. It would be too much, too late. The computing
        world in which Microsoft was nourished (on which it fed?)
        no longer exists. Along with the ubiquitous and global
        Internet have come new ways of setting standards. These
        days, more than market power is needed to influence the
        Internet's evolution. The fastest-growing area of
        computing is that of interconnected, wireless appliances
        and wearable devices. Microsoft has a <a
        href="http://www.3com.com/news/releases/pr99/oct1399a.html"
        target="_blank">long</a>, <a
        href="http://www.allnetdevices.com/news/9911/991115palm/991115palm.html"
        target="_blank">long</a> way to go before its presence is
        felt there. Then there's the open source movement.
        Microsoft has yet to demonstrate that it can negotiate
        the <a
        href="http://community.borland.com/devnews/article/1,1714,10550,00.html">rapid
        transition</a> from software royalties into services. And
        we've yet to see how Microsoft and the users of its
        products will fare once the new year arrives.</p>
        <p>One thing is certain: We shouldn't be scared of
        monsters anymore. If you're still concerned about
        Microsoft's power, there are things you can do. For your
        next project, why not base your choice of development
        environment on merits, rather than on market share? Why
        not get hold of a Linux distribution and learn to use it?
        How about learning to program on it? How about supporting
        more portable and open programming languages like Python,
        Perl, and Java? How about choosing something different
        from Windows to run the gadget you're giving yourself for
        Christmas? As we often tell kids, just ignore the monster
        and it will go away.</p>
