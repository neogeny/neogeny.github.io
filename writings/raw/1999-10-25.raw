        Open source programming underdogs may have more
        advantages than their critics imagine. But whether they
        win or lose in the end, it's their story that inspires.
        
        <p>Giving away software is a &quot;strategy of the
        weak.&quot; At least most business analysts
        consider&nbsp; it so when comparing the strategy against
        the &quot;embrace and extend&quot; strategies used by
        powerful software houses like Microsoft.</p>
        <p>But let me tell you a story that took place 584 years
        ago today. A story about the weak and their strategies.</p>
        <h2>Act I</h2>
        <img src="images/crispin.jpg" align="left" hspace="8"
        width="91" height="240">
        <p>On October 25, 1415, on <a
        href="http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/saintc21.htm"
        target="_blank">Saint Crispin's</a> day, a troop of
        tired, sick, and hungry men -- the unquestionably weak --
        defeated an enemy who not only outnumbered them
        four-to-one but who fought on their own turf. It was at
        the <a
        href="http://www.optonline.com/comptons/ceo/00080_A.html"
        target="_blank">Battle of Agincourt</a>, when <a
        href="http://www.blockbuster.com/video/title.tin?title_id=128648"
        target="_blank">King Henry V</a> led his troops into one
        of the greatest victories of military history.</p>
        <p>Six thousand English soldiers were marching in
        retreat. Their destination was the safe port of Calais,
        from whence they hoped to escape to England. They were
        intercepted at Agincourt by French Constable Charles
        d'Albret and a French army 25,000 strong, including
        armored cavalry and infantry. Annihilation of the English
        troops was imminent; they had no advantages -- except for
        the rain. It rained, and rained, and rained, and the
        battlefield became a quagmire. Mired in mud, the French
        cavalry were easy prey for the <a
        href="http://home.earthlink.net/~cva/agincourt.htm"
        target="_blank">English archers</a>. The heavily armored
        infantry men slipped and fell. Struggling to rise they
        were cut down by the hatchets, hooks, and knives of the
        highly mobile English raiders.</p>
        <p>For every Englishman killed, 25 French were slain.
        Some 500 French noblemen died on the field. The victory
        paved the way for English domination of most of France
        until the middle of the century.</p>
        <h2>Act II</h2>
        <p>Like the Constable d'Albret at Agincourt, most open
        source detractors misjudge the present situation.</p>
        <p>They misjudge open source programmers, accusing them
        of amateurism and claiming that their only motivation is
        peer recognition. Critics also jump to conclusions about
        where and how these programmers earn their income, and
        about their knowledge and skills. The critics are in for
        a surprise.</p>
        <p>And like d'Albret, analysts misjudge the battlefield
        as well. Today's internetworked world is fundamentally
        different from that on which the current software giants
        built their empires. And things are changing rapidly.
        Today, news of friends or foes, features or bugs, span
        the world in a matter of hours. Things are fundamentally
        different when anyone can post a question, and receive
        more than one authoritative answer from people across the
        globe. Things are fundamentally different when even your
        teenage son is among the ones posting the answers. Things
        are fundamentally different when the computer I carry in
        my waist pack is several times more powerful than the
        computer I learned to program on. It's raining folks.
        It's pouring!</p>
        <h2>Epilogue</h2>
        <p>Business analysts comment with a sneer that it's easy
        to double your market share every year when you start
        from zero. They speculate about what will happen when the
        software giants feel their territory threatened and
        decide to <a
        href="http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/news/msnw/linuxmyths.asp"
        target="_blank">charge</a>. They predict victory for the
        corporations; the apparently strong. But in the
        fast-changing world of the Internet, the advantage may
        well go to those who are flexible, agile, free from
        corporate inertia, and brave enough to take the risks.</p>
        <p>The Hundred Years War, of which Agincourt was part,
        was eventually won by the French, and the English were
        expelled from French territory. But the legend of the
        victory at Agincourt lives on.</p>
        <p>Likewise, the final outcome of the battles between the
        open source advocates and traditional business may not be
        the most important thing. It's the tale of open source
        and of the souls that fight for it that inspires, and
        will therefore last.</p>
