Java biking

Launching a full-blown IDE for a brief Java
programming excursion can be like driving the car to a
nearby shopping mall. If you have ever imagined the
equivalent of a Java bicycle, your fantasy may have come
true with BeanShell v. 1.0.

        <p>I'd just moved to Davis, California, and it was the
        first time I'd gone shopping. I parked my bicycle in an
        empty rack, dashed in, grabbed the few things I needed,
        and found a checkout register. </p>
        <p>&quot;Pehperohplahstig.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Sorry?&quot; The salute was unexpected, and the
        tinny accent of the northern-California girl didn't help.</p>
        <p>&quot;Paper-or-plastic?&quot; she repeated, more
        slowly this time. But it wasn't until the third time that
        I understood.</p>
        <p>&quot;Oh! Paper bags will be OK. Thanks.&quot;</p>
        <p>The reply &quot;You bet!&quot; was another surprise,
        but I didn't ask for translation. I paid, gathered my
        stuff, and hurried out, glad I could cycle home quickly
        with my groceries.</p>
        <p>As a young programmer, I was always in a hurry, and if
        there's a heaven for bikers, it is the little town of
        Davis. My apartment was well within walking distance of
        the shopping mall, but I preferred to ride. It took only
        a few minutes to reach the mall by bike, most of them
        spent waiting at the Russell Avenue crossing.&nbsp;
        Driving would have been overkill for such a short trip --
        especially considering the effects on the ozone layer --
        and probably the most time-consuming of the options.</p>
        <p>I've often felt that launching a full-blown
        development environment for a brief <a
        href="http://java.sun.com" target="_blank">Java</a>
        programming excursion is like taking the car out to go to
        the nearby mall. Yet going about with just a text editor
        and the command line compiler seems too cumbersome, too
        much like going on foot -- especially if the task at hand
        is not trivial, or if it's one of those days when one out
        of ten key-presses is a typing error. The solution
        I've&nbsp; imagined would be something equivalent to a
        Java programming bicycle.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I went Web-spelunking and found a beta version of what
        promised to be the ideal solution to my short programming
        excursion needs -- someday. Then, just a couple of weeks
        ago, I was notified by e-mail that <a
        href="http://www.beanshell.org/" target="_blank">BeanShell
        1.0</a> was available. I decided to take the tool for a
        ride.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.beanshell.org/" target="_blank">BeanShell</a>
        is a small interpreter written in Java by <a
        href="mailto:pat@pat.net" target="_blank">Pat Niemeyer</a>.
        It executes standard Java statements and expressions in
        addition to several scripting commands. The tool supports
        scripted objects as simple method closures like those in <a
        href="http://www.perl.org/" target="_blank">Perl</a> and
        JavaScript. BeanShell is open source and free to use
        under the terms of the <a
        href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html"
        target="_blank">GNU General Public License</a>.</p>
        <p>BeanShell comes with both GUI (Swing) and console mode
        interpreters. The GUI interpreter provides command
        history recall, command line editing, cut and paste,
        support for multiple sessions, and a simple editor for
        scripts.</p>
        <p><img src="images/beanshot.jpg"
        alt="A screen shot the BeanShell interpreter in GUI mode."
        align="left" hspace="8" width="288" height="314">The
        language interpreted by BeanShell is very similar to
        JavaScript. There's no need to declare variables or
        parameter types; the tool does type checking at runtime.
        Any class, object, or method available to the Java
        interpreter can be accessed from within BeanShell using
        standard Java syntax. The interpreter understands Java
        import statements, and it provides a convenient syntax
        for accessing Java Bean properties. External commands can
        be invoked from within the interpreter using the exec
        command, so you can also access other tools, like your
        favorite editor or the Java compiler, from within the
        shell. Several other useful commands and variables --
        such as dir, print, and cwd -- are provided by default,
        and the built-in command set can be readily extended
        using either BeanShell scripts or Java.</p>
        <p>BeanShell can also be embedded into your applications
        to provide them with scripting functionality. The core
        interpreter, with all console functionality removed, fits
        in a 135K Jar file. The tool also provides a &quot;server
        mode,&quot; which allows for remote access to the
        interpreter using HTTP. Upon gaining access to the
        specified TCP port, BeanShell will send back a remote
        console applet that can be used to query or change the
        state of the running application in which BeanShell is
        embedded. It's also possible to talk to the interpreter
        in terminal mode by using the Telnet protocol.</p>
        <p>The documentation, which is available from the
        BeanShell Web site, includes the script language's
        syntax, the built-in commands, and instructions for
        installing, running, and embedding the tool. A set of
        JavaDoc pages covers the product's internal API. There is
        a mailing list for BeanShell users and developers on the
        site as well.</p>
        <p>With BeanShell at hand I can easily experiment with
        libraries and classes I develop or download from the
        Internet without recompiling, and without bothering to
        set up a new project in the IDE. As it turns out, my Java
        bike was not just a fantasy after all.</p>
