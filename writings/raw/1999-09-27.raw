A true story

What &quot;revolution&quot;? A long-term open source enthusiast describes his conversion.

<p>Source code has been available for decades, long
before the so-called &quot;open source revolution&quot;
started. I have found value in using and writing open
source software since I first began experimenting with
open source solutions to critical business problems. It's
easy to become paranoid about backups after the first
important loss of work to a system failure. For me it
happened while in college, and I flunked the project. The
next stage of paranoia comes when one groks that the
precious latest backups will frequently have a much
lesser value than the backups of previous working
versions. Such a revelation will motivate most
programmers to implement some sort of version control and
backup strategy. At the next stage, one realizes that the
contents of the version control database are the real
source, and that what any given source directory contains
is just a partial image of the whole thing.</p>

<p>My early primitive attempts at version control (file
renaming, directory cloning) eventually led to the
installation of a commercial version control package:
Microsoft Delta. Delta was not an ambitious package. It
lacked many features that other packages advertised, and
its documentation was lacking in many places. But I had
received my copy for free by raving about Microsoft in a
local newspaper, so I decided to give it a shot. Delta
served my version control needs flawlessly for years
until, unexpectedly, Microsoft decided to drop the
software.</p>

<p>&quot;What the heck,&quot; I thought. &quot;The
software works fine, so why not continue to use it
unsupported?&quot; But 1995 arrived, and with it Windows
95. Delta simply would not cooperate with the new 32-bit
OS. As the product had been discontinued, the only
support option provided was a free upgrade to SourceSafe,
which Microsoft had recently acquired. My initial
evaluation of SourceSafe left me wary of a version
control system that would store my source code in an
undocumented, proprietary binary format. I queried the
Net (CompuServe at that time) and found out about the
many problems people were having with SourceSafe. I
decided to pass on this system and evaluate other
commercial options.</p>

<p>Good version control comes third in a software
developer's toolbox only because a compiler that produces
correct output, and libraries that do what they should,
are things one simply can't live without. After ruling
out SourceSafe, I bought and evaluated the two most
recognized and touted version control packages under
US$1000. To my surprise, both packages were difficult to
use and, worse, they failed to perform routine tasks on
their first day of use. The advertised ability to import
my Delta files didn't work either. Tech support
acknowledged the problems, but the only solution offered
was to wait for the next release &quot;due out in a
couple of months.&quot; That was unacceptable.</p>

<p>At the obvious signs of hyperventilation, I decided to
stop breathing for a while. I realized I would inevitably
lose my Delta database and, with it, all the whys and
hows of every version of my software. I decided that the
next version control package I used would have to rely on
a database format that was standard, well documented, and
humanly auditable (plain text). Then I remembered RCS,
&quot;Revision Control System,&quot; the version control
system bundled with every version of Unix. I found a
Windows implementation of RCS on the Net in no time, and
all the tests I performed ran fine. RCS was open source,
and I could use it for my needs at no charge.</p>

<p>RCS's only weakness was its lack of network
consciousness; this eventually led me to CVS, the
Concurrent Versioning System. CVS is open source
software, it is licensed under the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">General
Public License</a> and has <a
href="http://www.cyclic.com/">Cyclic Software</a> as its
official maintainer. CVS is very network conscious, it
supports collaborative (no locks) check-ins and
check-outs and branching, and is the primary version
control package used for open source projects all over
the Net. Most importantly, CVS uses the RCS file format,
an open specification of version control databases held
in plain text.</p>

<p>I've used CVS for my version control needs for years,
and it has always performed flawlessly. The free upgrades
have simplified the installation and made important
performance improvements. More than once I've queried the
CVS source code to see how things really work; it helped
me implement my Java RCS library (open source), which I
wrote in order to guarantee that I would never lose my
version control information again.</p>

<p>Individual developers may have reasons of their own to
resist open source, but sometimes it is the best solution
to a business need. I'm still paranoid about version
control, so I plan to release my RCS library as open
source. </p>
