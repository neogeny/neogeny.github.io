Start the revolution without me

Confused by the ruckus over open-source software?
Bobby McFerrin had it right: Don't worry, keep hacking.

        <p>Everybody's talking about the &quot;open software
        revolution.&quot; From geek forums like SlashDot to
        academic journals like <i>Communications of the ACM, </i>from
        the <i>New York Times </i>to <i>The Wall Street Journal, </i>everyone
        is saying that there's something important going on.</p>
        <p>The leaders of the open-source movement argue that
        their way of doing things will change the world of
        software development forever. Detractors question their
        leadership and attack their ideas on business, logical,
        economic, political, sociological, and other grounds. The
        hubbub is rising so fast I've seen good friends worry
        that open-source software may destroy their way of life
        by making it impossible to sell software or write it for
        hire.</p>
        <p>I'm not at home with the rhetoric of any of the
        factions. I'm not a radical, I'm a programmer. You say
        you want a revolution? You can count me out.</p>
        <h2>War of the words</h2>
        <p>Like many programmers, I have used and written
        open-source software for a long time. I'm glad that we
        now have a phrase -- <i>open source -</i>- to describe
        what we've been doing. But I object to narrow definitions
        that exclude workable, time-honored, and popular
        practices. Now that we have a buzzword, people are trying
        to cram political and economic agendas into the term.</p>
        <p>There are those, for instance, who argue that
        open-source development is the solution to all software
        development problems. But they do so based on information
        drawn from just a few successful projects. Most of the
        open-source projects I have tracked over the past 18
        months have been cancelled, only to become data points
        that feed the well-known statistics about the high
        failure rate of software projects. Methodologies are a
        dozen for a penny; these projects failed because they
        never had a feasible business plan.</p>
        <p>In the opposite corner are those who see the
        open-source movement as a&nbsp; threat to the software
        industry. Never mind that open-source initiatives are
        law-abiding and -- because of their open nature -- much
        less likely to fall into the anticompetitive practices
        that characterize a part of our industry. Never mind that
        thousands of developers are gainfully employed on
        open-source projects. Never mind that hundreds of
        thousands of users entrust their businesses to their
        work. They are convinced that the sky is falling.</p>
        <p>Then there's the debate over &quot;free&quot;
        software.</p>
        <p>On one side are the developers and activists who
        believe software should not be treated as intellectual
        property. Or that it should be treated like intellectual
        property, but developers should waive their property
        rights.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On the other side are people who oppose free software.
        Some because they think it's impractical, and some
        because the initiative seems politically suspect -- too
        leftish. The extreme left has become extremely unpopular
        in most circles, and all of this talk of free software
        smacks of outmoded socialist ideas. As long as those
        impressions persist, I don't see how the free software
        cause can make it to a critical mass of supporters.</p>
        <p>Intellectual property has been a hairy issue since the
        invention of speech at least, and intense debates about
        it precede the Internet era by centuries. The debates are
        so intense, you have to wonder how any country's founding
        fathers were able to quiet the ruckus long enough to slip
        intellectual-property language into their constitutions.</p>
        <p>The shouting's so loud, it's tempting to ignore the
        arguments. But you can't simply ignore the
        &quot;free&quot; versus &quot;proprietary&quot; software
        debate -- no more than you would ignore debates between
        Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. or Greens and
        Social Democrats in Germany. This debate is truly about
        ideas. It's worthy of your attention.</p>
        <p>It is difficult to write about these issues without
        making a contribution to the arguments. But I'm
        determined: I'm not about to take a side on these issues.
        I do think that open-source development will impact
        software development in general, and in an important way.
        But I think that the effect won't be immediate, and it
        won't be obvious. To know what this
        &quot;revolution&quot; will actually lead to...well, you
        have to wait. My take is that the factions will
        ultimately reconcile.</p>
        <p>Strip away the rhetoric and it's clear: There is no
        revolution. The ideas being argued and shouted are
        interesting, and important, yes, but their effect will be
        evolutionary. Like always.</p>
        <p>So don't worry. It will be all right.</p>
